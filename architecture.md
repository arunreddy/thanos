# Database Observability Chatbot
## Technical Architecture Documentation

### Overview
This document describes the architecture of the Database Observability Chatbot system designed for automating database management tasks through a conversational interface. The system leverages natural language processing to interpret user requests, executes both immediate and long-running database tasks, and maintains state across interactions.

### Core Components

#### 1. Frontend Layer
**Purpose**: Provides the user interface for interacting with the chatbot.

**Components**:
- **React + Tailwind UI**: Responsive chat interface that supports text inputs, structured outputs, and database visualizations
- **WebSocket Client**: Manages real-time communication with the backend for streaming responses and task status updates

**Responsibilities**:
- Display conversation history
- Render structured data responses (tables, charts)
- Provide typing indicators during processing
- Show task progress for long-running operations

#### 2. API Gateway
**Purpose**: Central entry point for all client interactions, handling authentication and routing.

**Components**:
- **FastAPI Server**: High-performance asynchronous API framework
- **Authentication Module**: Manages user authentication and authorization

**Responsibilities**:
- Route requests to appropriate services
- Manage WebSocket connections
- Handle user authentication/authorization
- Rate limiting and request validation
- API documentation (via Swagger/OpenAPI)

#### 3. NLU Service
**Purpose**: Interprets natural language queries about database management.

**Components**:
- **Rasa NLU Engine**: Processes natural language to extract intents and entities
- **Slot Elicitation Module**: Prompts users for missing information required to complete tasks

**Responsibilities**:
- Identify user intents (query database, optimize performance, troubleshoot issues)
- Extract key parameters from user messages
- Manage conversation flow for complex multi-step tasks
- Elicit missing information through follow-up questions

#### 4. Task Processor
**Purpose**: Executes database operations and manages long-running tasks.

**Components**:
- **Arq Workers**: Processes that handle asynchronous database operations
- **Task Queue**: Manages job prioritization and execution

**Responsibilities**:
- Execute immediate database operations
- Schedule and monitor long-running tasks
- Provide task status updates to frontend
- Implement retry logic and error handling
- Execute database management commands

#### 5. Storage Layer
**Purpose**: Maintains system state and persists historical data.

**Components**:
- **Redis Cache**: In-memory data store for session state and temporary data
  - Store conversation context
  - Track active tasks
  - Cache frequent queries
  - Manage session state
  
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Persistent storage for historical data and configuration
  - Store conversation history
  - Archive task results
  - Maintain user preferences
  - Log system activity
  - Store database metadata
