        1. Oracle:
           - Recommended for structured data in vendor/home-grown applications with special Oracle-only features.  
           - Best suited for single-key relationships and any downtime tolerance.

        2. MySQL/PostgreSQL:
           - Ideal for structured data with flexible database needs and single-key relationships.  
           - Recommended when there are no special relationships or complex schema requirements.

        3. PostgreSQL/SQL Server: 
           - Suitable for structured data with flexible database needs and complex relationships or schema.  
           - Recommended for relational databases that require high uptime.

        4. MongoDB: 
           - Best for unstructured data with flexible database needs and no special relationships or schema.  
           - Recommended when there are no complex relationships or schema requirements.

        5. Neo4j: 
           - Recommended for unstructured data with flexible database needs and complex relationships.  
           - Best suited for handling complex graph-based relationships in the data.

        6. Multi-AZ Deployment (PostgreSQL/SQL Server/MongoDB):  
           - Best suited for any data type (structured/unstructured) with no special features.  
           - Requires high uptime tolerance and is recommended for highly available database setups.

        7. Single Instance with Snapshot:
           - Suitable for any data type (structured/unstructured) with no special features.  
           - Tolerates low uptime and is ideal for simple setups with snapshot backups.
